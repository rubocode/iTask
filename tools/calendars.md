## Calendars

* A calendar is a bucket of events.
* A calendar app, almost universally, support multiple calendars.
* It is an excellent idea to use a separate calendar for each of your spheres.
* I use a consistent color code for spheres.
* If you have multiple email addresses and therefore multiple calendar in a single sphere, your color code provides stability and consistency.
