## Reminders

* Reminders or todo lists a straight forward way to keep track of tasks and tick them off as you finish them.
* Most todo apps support multiple lists and often allow them to be grouped under categories.
* They support #tags or labels so that you can search easier.
* They support due dates and sometime a separate deadline.
* They support repeatability so that you can get alerts for monthly bills for example.

### Strategies

* It is a good idea to have a handful of high-level categories.
* You may want a few lists inside each category depending on your needs.
* The lesser the number of lists, the better.
