## Kanban

* A board contains a handful of columns.
* A column is usually related to a sequential ordering of cards.
* A tasks is introduced into a columns, move around until it gets done and later archived or discarded.
* A typical arrangement of columns of **Todo**, **Doing** and **Done**.
* You could also use a card flow from right to left with the columns as **Done**, **Now**, **Next** and **Later**.
* A unhealthy balance in the board occurs when you have columns with too many tasks.
* All your cards must fit inside a single page or screen for the board to be useful as a high level visualization tool.
* Keep it simple and flexible.
