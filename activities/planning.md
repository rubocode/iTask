## Planning

Planning is done in broad strokes.  It is a bird’s eye view.  That view is high level and it helps if you keep it reasonably stable.  It gives you a good grounding in what you do.  You see the big picture and it gives you the confidence to navigate the day to day.

Visions help you organize your planning activity.  You are looking to capture the essence of the moving parts in generating the outcomes you want and have some sense of sequence.  Kanbans are quite effective in managing visions.

You can juggle the sequencing — priorities — at a high level and visualize them from the mountain top.  You will do this at any given time when you balance priorities as well as in facing new challenges that have an impact on the plan.

Be an eagle!
