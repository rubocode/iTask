## Working

You keep track of your work using the notion of a project.  A project — for this purpose — is simply a list of tasks.  A project corresponds to a category.  Projects can be grouped inside spheres.

If you’re a consultant like me, you will have multiple clients.  You can have a sphere called **Consulting** which will house a project each for each active client.

This is a baseline.  Once you realize that less hassle is better, you will settle on the simplest arrangement of projects that works for you.  Anything less simple will also prove unsuitable.  You need to find your optimal combination.
