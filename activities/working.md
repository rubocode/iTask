## Working

You keep track of your work using the notion of a project.  A project — for this purpose — is simply a list of tasks.

It is useful to track all your projects in one place inside one tool.  Your projects can be grouped under categories.  You can use the three spheres for this in most cases.

If you’re a consultant like me, you will have multiple clients.  You can have a category called **Consulting** which will house a project each for each active client.  Your own **Marketing**, **Finance** and **Operations** projects will continue to be grouped under **Business**.

This is a baseline.  Once you realize that less hassle is better, you will settle on the simplest arrangement of projects that works for you.  Anything less simple will also prove unsuitable.  You need to find your optimal combination.
