## Planning

Planning is done in broad strokes.  It is a birds eye view.  That view is high level and reasonably stable.  It gives you a good grounding in what you do.  You see the big picture and it gives you the confidence to navigate the day to day.

The best tool for this that I have found is a **Kanban Board**.  You pick a topic — often one of a handful of long term goals or a strategic plan.  Then you organize a bunch of cards across a bunch of columns.  The column choices can be quote arbitrary to suit your particular situation.

In most cases, you can use the four columns — **Done**, **Now**, **Next** and **Later**.  You don’t need to use any timing, estimates or automation.  You place high level tasks on cards and move them around the columns.  You’re looking to capture the essence of the moving parts in the problem you’re trying to solve and have a sense of sequence.

You can juggle the sequencing — priorities — at a high level and visualize them from the mountain top.  You will do this at any given time when you balance priorities as well as in facing new challenges that have an impact on the plan.

You can use categories and tags as you please, but often they constrain your flexibility.  Use your judgement.
