## Journaling

Journaling is quite useful in keeping track of your ideas, thought, meeting to telephone call details as necessary.  The journal can also used to collect notable quotes, web links and other minutiae that you would otherwise forget.

A journal is often organized using the notion of a folder. You could usefully think of each folder belonging to your favorite **Business**, **Personal** and **Social** categories.  Often — however — most journals do not support the idea of a category in the sense we are thinking of it.  They merely support folders that assimilate notes.

Each entry — a note — in the journal can be categorized and tagged.  Each entry has a title and content.  It also has one of two timestamps — creation date and modified date.

Again, find your balance under a dozen folders.  The key criteria is that a folder name stands the test of time in housing your notes.

If you have too small a number of folders, you will have to use tags a lot more and things get murky.  If you have more than a dozen folders, perhaps, you don’t have enough clarity on your chosen priorities.  You will surprise yourself trying to design your optimal set of folders, gaining clarity on your long term objectives.
