## Logging

It is quite useful to keep track of thoughts, ideas,  observations and records of meetings and conversations as deemed necessary.  You can also collect notable quotes, web links and other minutiae that you would otherwise forget.  You log these in a journal or a notes app.

Your logs are organized using folders which are essentially buckets.  Each entry has a title and content and optionally multiple tags.  It also has two timestamps — creation date and modified date.

Again, find your balance under a dozen folders.  The key criteria is that a folder name stands the test of time in housing your logs.  If you have too small a number of folders, you will have to use tags a lot more and things get murky.  If you have more than a dozen folders, perhaps, you don’t have enough clarity on your chosen priorities.

You will surprise yourself trying to design your optimal set of folders, gaining clarity on your long term objectives.
