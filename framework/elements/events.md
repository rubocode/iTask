## Events

> The only thing you have in your life is time.  If you invest that time in yourself to have great experiences that are going to enrich you, then you can’t possibly lose.  
> **Steve Jobs**

* Events allow us to make explicit time commitments as part of organizing tasks — ultimately, to accomplish goals and fulfill visions.
* Events help us prioritize and schedule our activity.
