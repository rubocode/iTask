## Kanbans

* A kanban is a board that contains a handful of columns.
* A column is usually related to a sequential ordering of cards.
* A card will have a title and a handful of bullet points.
* A card is introduced into one of the columns, moved around until it gets done and later archived or discarded.
* A typical arrangement of columns is the trio **Todo**, **Doing** and **Done**.
* You could also use a card flow from right to left with the columns as **Done**, **Now**, **Next** and **Later**.
* You need to limit the number of cards to about a dozen and keep it very high level.
* Kanbans are very effective at helping you [plan](/iTask/framework/activities/planning) with [visions](/iTask/framework/things/visions).
* Keep it abstract, simple and flexible.
* Here is an [example](/iTask/framework/examples/catban).
