## Kanbans

* A kanban is a board that contains a handful of columns.
* A columns will contain a set of cards.
* A card will have a title and a handful of bullet points.
* A card is introduced into one of the columns, moved around until it gets done and later archived or discarded.
* A typical arrangement of columns is the trio **Todo**, **Doing** and **Done**.
* You could also use arbitrary column names such as **Concepts**, **Processes**, **Tools** and **Strategies**.
* You need to limit the number of cards to about a dozen and keep it very high level.
* Kanbans are very effective at helping you [plan](/iTask/framework/activities/planning) with [visions](/iTask/framework/elements/visions).
* Keep it abstract, simple and flexible.
