## Kanbans

* A kanban is a board that contains a handful of columns.
* A columns will contain a set of cards.
* A card will have a title and a handful of bullet points.
* A card is introduced into one of the columns, moved around until it gets done and later archived or discarded.
* A typical arrangement of columns is the trio _Todo_, _Doing_ and _Done_.
* You could also use arbitrary column names such as _Concepts_, _Processes_, _Tools_ and _Strategies_.
* You need to limit the number of cards to about a dozen and keep it very high level.
* Kanbans are very effective at helping you [plan](/iTask/framework/activities/planning) with [visions](/iTask/framework/elements/visions).
* Keep it abstract, simple and flexible.
