## Lists

* A list is a bucket for tasks.
* There are various tools of different sophistication that can manage lists of tasks.
* Apple’s default app **Reminders** is simple, elegant and — at the same time — sophisticated.
* Cultured Code has an app called **Things**, which focuses more on flow and can be useful if you are sometimes overwhelmed by your task volume.
* A kanban such as **Trello** can be used to manage task flow as well.  In that case, your columns regulate flow and your buckets become labels.
