## Calendars

> The most precious thing that we all have with us is time.

* A calendar is a bucket for events.
* A calendar app, almost universally, support multiple calendars.
* It is an excellent idea to use a separate calendar for each of your facets.
* Use a consistent color code for facets.
* If you have multiple email addresses and therefore multiple calendars in a single sphere, your color code provides order and consistency.
