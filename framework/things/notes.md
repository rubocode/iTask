## Notes

* Notes facilitate our thinking process.
* We keep track of our ideas, insights and third party information relevant to our activity.
* We keep notes on our visions, tasks and events.
* Notes facilitate the translation of our hunches and intuitions into concrete language and make them explicit.
* They also help you revisit and correct any mistakes, confusions and inaccuracies in very specific terms.
* Notes help you think clearly and helps you improve your judgement over time.
