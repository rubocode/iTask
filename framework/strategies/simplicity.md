## Simplicity

> That’s been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity.

* Use a separate app particularly suited for each kind of element.
* You may use facet names as top level bucket names.
* Use only a handful of buckets, at most a dozen.
* Use bucket names in a consistent manner across your apps.
