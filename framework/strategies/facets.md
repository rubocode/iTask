## Facets

> Things don’t have to change the world to be important.  
> **Steve Jobs**

* You operate in three primary facets of life — _Business_, _Personal_ and _Social_.
* Some people manage with just _Work_ and _Home_.
* It helps to use a consistent color code for the facets: _blue_ for _Business_, _green_ for _Personal_ and _purple_ for _Social_.
* Work would be blue and home would be green.
* You can use these with any app.
* Use them consistently.
