## Apps

> Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.  
> **Steve Jobs**

* An app is an activity center that often helps us productively manage a kind of thing.
* It may be the case that your tasks may reside in more than one app — reminders for daily living and a more sophisticated app for more complex project work.
