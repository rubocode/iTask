There are three primary facets in the life of an individual — _Business_, _Personal_ and _Social_.  Some people prefer to use a simpler arrangement with _Work_ and _Home_.  

### Business
* The business facet is concerned with economic activity.
* You meet the needs of another who would pay you for it.
* The economy includes the provision of both goods and services.
* The activity is primarily transactional.

### Personal
* The personal facet is concerned with the wellbeing of yourself and your family.
* You need purpose and meaning in your life.
* You are on a spiritual journey.
* You are the leader of your life.
* It — obviously — is a lifelong commitment.
* You need to approach it with great care.

### Social
* The social facet is concerned with your relationships outside your family.
* It includes your service to humanity.
* You choose your affiliations to fulfill your purpose in life.
* You have friends, colleagues and acquaintances.
