## Working

You keep track of your work using buckets.  These buckets may correspond to buckets or clients.

If you’re a consultant like me, you will have multiple clients.  You may decide to define a facet called _Consulting_ and house your client buckets there.  Alternatively, you may define a facet called _Work_ and house your projects there.

This is a baseline.  Once you realize that less hassle is better, you will settle on the simplest arrangement of buckets that works for you.  Anything less simple will also prove unsuitable.  You need to find your optimal combination.
