The holy grail in task management is figuring out the right set of buckets.  You do this by starting at a reasonable place and experimenting.  The name of the bucket gives it meaning.  This matters when you have a thing and want to figure out which bucket you will use for that.

The examples give you a particular choice the author has made for himself.  You may use it as an example, or a starting point or may pick some subset that suits you and add your own set of buckets that fit your unique situation in life right now.

Of course, you will make improvements as you go.  The more sure you’re of your purpose in life, the more stable your set of buckets.  Then you move through life with such ease.
