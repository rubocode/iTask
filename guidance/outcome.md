## Focus on the Outcome

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.  You have to pick carefully.  
> **Steve Jobs**

When you decide you want something, you have to be very clear what that thing is.  You also should know why you want it.  For example, let’s say you want to develop a web application and you don’t know any programming.  Now the outcome you want is a web app.

You may decide to learn how to program and then write the web app.  That means, you would like to learn programming too, which becomes a second outcome you want.  But, if all you want is the app developed for some immediate purpose, your approach should probably be to hire someone to do it for you.  What that person will want to know would be what the features and functionality of that product should be.  In this case, the outcome you would be responsible for is the requirements analysis and specification.

In either case, what is true is that the outcomes remain the same, no matter who will be doing it.  The web app needs to be built, its requirements analysis and specification needs to be done and someone has to do the programming.  This captures the essence of the desired outcome and gives you the opportunity to accomplish that with greater flexibility.

Focus on the outcome, you will be glad you did.
