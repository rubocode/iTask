## Think on Paper

Things are intertwined in the mind.  When an intention is ignited, you may choose to act on it or not.  Sometimes, this decision may be trivial.  Sometimes, it may reflect a very conscious and deliberate choice.  Even when it is a negative choice, it would be worth it to write it down as a note on your log.  That gives your mind closure.

If you choose to act on it, it is because you want something to happen.  That something is a task.  It is wise to capture that as well.  Now your mind does not have to work hard to remember it.  Your tool will remember it.  You give your mind closure.

You can later come back and get rid of the task.  Or you can add additional tasks and plan events to accomplish that task.  All of this is done where it is visual on your tool.  You have captured the fruit of your thinking.  You can benefit from it later.  Otherwise, it would have vanished from your mind without benefitting you much.

Whatever tool or medium you want to capture your thinking, it is worthwhile.  Once you have the initial seed, you can build on it and improve upon it.
