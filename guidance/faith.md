## Keep the Faith

> Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  Don’t lose faith.  
> **Steve Jobs**

When you follow your heart with an open mind, you will learn along the way.  You may even find out that you were on a wild goose chase.  But you needed to learn the lesson first hand so that you become wiser for it.

There will be other challenges along the way.  But there is nothing better to do in life than to believe in yourself and follow your heart.  But why is that the case?  Imagine the alternative — eat, drink, entertainment, sleep and repeat the same tomorrow.  How sad!

Believe you can do it.  Be kind to others.  You’ll get there!
