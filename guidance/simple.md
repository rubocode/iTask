## Keep it Simple

> Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.  
> **Steve Jobs**

The sole purpose of capturing things you need to do, the reasoning and relevant knowledge is to enable you to be flexible in the face of challenges.  You will often need to reevaluate your choices.  You also get a sense of predictability  and stability around your activity.

Don’t complicate that set of tools with unnecessary baggage.  For example, if you want to read a book, don’t create a task each for each chapter.  That would be kind of sad.  You need to trust yourself.   Tools can’t do that.  You have to do that yourself.

As mentioned elsewhere, for most things, a half a dozen buckets will do.  Notes is a slight exception as you might want a couple more folders to organize your logs to reflect on how you view your information.

While it requires some effort to organize yourself some simplicity out of complexity and chaos, it is a worthwhile effort.  Your thinking and reasoning along that path guides you into understanding what you stand for, where you are going and what your priorities and values are.

That is worth quite a bit!
