## Follow your Heart

When you try to plan your life out on paper, you will have to confront hard realities.  You will have to ask tough questions.  What are you doing on this planet anyway?  What should I do with my life?  Should I give priority to finding that out or should I just chase money for now?  What will make me happy?  When will I stop running the rat race?  Is there an alternative? How do I find out?  Will someone else’s answers apply to me?

The best approach to tackle this is to think of yourself as completely unique, that there has never been and will never be anyone else like you.  This perspective helps you evaluate what others say more objectively.  Do I understand what they are saying?  Are they right?  What do I think of that?

Ultimately, you will need to follow your heart, because no one else can tell you where you should be headed.
