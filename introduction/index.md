Many believe that the process of managing your life is one of managing time.  Unfortunately, you can’t manage time.  It just passes by whether you like it or not.

What you do have control over is what you choose to do and what you choose not to do.  This is not a trivial task, especially considering the unpredictability of life.

If life were simply a matter of figuring out how long a task would take and doing it, we would not have been such a complex brain.  The major task in life is figuring out why you are here and then getting about that business.

It helps tremendously to look at life from a task management perspective instead of a time management perspective.  iTask is a conceptual framework that helps you with a simple, elegant yet sophisticated approach to managing tasks that is eminently practical.
