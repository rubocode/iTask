## Simplicity

* Use a separate app for each of our primary activities — living, journaling, planning and working.
* Use spheres as top level categories.
* Use only a handful of top level categories.
* Use a small number of lists in each app — often less than a dozen.
* Use categories in a consistent manner across your apps.
