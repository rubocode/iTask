## Apps

* An app is an activity center that often helps us with a specialized set of activities.
* Use a separate app for each of our primary activities — living, planning, working and logging.
* You may use spheres for simple and high level organization inside an app.
* Sometimes, you can use a handful of meaningful categories instead. 
* Maintain a separation between concerns.
