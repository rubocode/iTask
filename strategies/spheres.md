## Spheres

* You operate in three primary spheres — **Business**, **Personal** and **Social**.
* Some people manage with just **Work** and **Home**.
* It helps to use a consistent color code for the spheres: blue for business, green for personal and purple for social.
* Work would be blue and home would be green.
* You can use these with any app.
* Use them consistently.
