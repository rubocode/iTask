## Visions

Visions provide high level direction and guidance.  They provide purpose to activity.

A vision is not just a tagline.  It contains multiple parts.  It needs to be designed well for execution.  It has to provide clarity on the expected outcomes.

A vision facilitates strategy and planning.  Strategy is creative problem solving.  Planning is the organization of execution.
