## Mindsets

> Your time is limited.  Don't waste it living someone else's life.  
> **Steve Jobs**

The way you look at life drives the way you live it.  For our purposes here, we consider two mindsets — an entrepreneur mindset and an employee mindset.

Entrepreneurs get paid for solving a problem, doing it better than others and at a lower cost in both time and money.  They look at life from a task management point of view.

Employees get paid for time.  The longer they spend on a problem, the more they get paid.  They are not incentivized to produce better quality solutions because of the very nature of the earnings philosophy.  They look at life from a time management point of view.

There are all kinds of magic that entrepreneurs use to motivate their employees to produce faster, better and cheaper solutions.  They end up doing this by psychological manipulation instead of genuine reward structures.

Then they blame each other.  Class struggle!  Karl Marx smirks from his corner in hell.  Task management is for masters, time management is for slaves.
