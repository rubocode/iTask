## Categories

* Categories are buckets where things are stored.
* A given thing can only be stored reside in only one bucket.
* Therefore, obviously, it can’t be stored in two buckets at the same time.
* A particular choice of categories can significantly simplify managing across multiple activities.
* Lesser the number of categories, the simpler the management.
* However, you need to capture the essential complexity in your life.
* You need to choose your categories carefully as that the lens through which you see your activity.

### Business

* This is the sphere where your categories are most dynamic.
* A project might get its own category and will vanish after it is completed.
* It all depends on the specific nature of your work.
* The owner of a business might decide to use **marketing**, **finance** and **operations** as high level categories and they will remain stable.
* It all depends on how you slice the cake.

### Personal

* The categories here can be more stable and somewhat similar between individuals.
* You may have a separate category for each individual in your family.
* Alternatively, you may decide to keep one category called **Family** and use tags to help distinguish between family members.

### Social

* The categories here will correspond to how you organize your social activity.
* You will often have a **friends** category.
* You will also have separate categories for your religious, political or services to humanity affiliations.
