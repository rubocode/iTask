## Spheres

| Business | Personal | Social |

* There are three primary spheres of operation for an individual.
* You may introduce a new sphere when it allows a better organization of your activity.
* In almost all cases, however, these three suffice.

### Business
* The business sphere is concerned with economic activity.
* You meet the needs of another who would pay you for it.
* The economy includes both goods and services.
* The activity is primarily transactional.

### Personal
* The personal sphere is concerned with wellbeing of yourself and your family.
* You need purpose and meaning in your life.
* There is a spiritual journey.
* These are life long commitments.
* You are ultimately responsible for how your personal life turns out.
* You need to approach the personal sphere with great care.

### Social
* The social sphere is concerned with your relationships outside your family.
* It includes your service to humanity.
* You choose your affiliations to fulfill your purpose in life.
* You may have friends, acquaintances and colleagues with whom you need to coordinate activity.
