## Deadline

A deadline indicates the worst case scenarios of how late you can be in getting a thing done.  Often, this is a useful thing to know and you are not the one controlling it.

Whether you have a know deadline or not, you can attach a due date to a thing to help juggle it around.  You can plan to get it done way before the deadline if the opportunity presents itself.

If something doesn’t need to be done yet, it means that things of higher importance can be done immediately.  It is also possible that the nature of the desired thing may change towards the time it becomes needed.
