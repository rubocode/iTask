## Sequence

Things can be sequenced in different ways based on the need at hand.  Sometimes, it is enough just to attach a due date to a thing and all would be well.

Often, you need to take a higher perspective of the flow of activity in your life — be it in a project at work, planning your kid’s activities or coordinating teamwork.

It may be useful to put your things in buckets named _now_, _next_, _later_ and _someday_ and then move things around as needed.
