## Personal

* [Reminders Example](reminders)

Personal activity boils down to keeping track of reminders in an organized manner.  Anything more complicated is project activity and the way it is handled is more involved.

I use the **Reminders** app to keep track of these. The categories **Family**, **Finances**, **Society** and **Books** are often adequate.

There can be separate lists under each category for when you need to be more discerning in separating concerns.  For example, I have a separate list called **Bills** under the **Finances** category with monthly reminders for the dozen or or so such items.  The **Society** category has a list called **Friends**.

The structure and categories are often quite stable.  This is your private life.  Work stuff stays off of this activity center.  When you want to have a look at your private commitments, you visit this activity center.
