## Planning

Planning is broad strokes.  It is a birds eye view.  That view is high level and reasonable stable.  It gives you a good grounding in what you do.  You see the bigger picture and it gives you the confidence to navigate the day to day.

The best tool for this that I have found is a **Kanban Board**.  I use four columns — **Done**, **Now**, **Next** and **Later**.  I don’t use any timing, estimates or any automation.  I place high level tasks on cards and move them around the four columns.

You can juggle the sequencing — priorities — at a high level and visualize from the mountain top.

The tool I use is called **Catban**.  It is markdown based and is quite simple to use.  **Trello** can work for you too.  It is a bit heavier for the task, but it cuts the mustard.
