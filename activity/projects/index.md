## Projects

Project activity keeps track of numerous tasks organized using the notion of a project.  A project — for the purpose of tracking — is a list of tasks.

It is useful to track all your projects in one place inside one tool.  Your projects can be grouped under high level categories.  You can use the three categories **Business**, **Personal** and **Social** in most cases.

If you’re a consultant like me, you will have multiple clients.  You can have a category called **Consulting** which will house a project each for each active client.  Your own **Marketing**, **Finance** and **Operations** projects will continue to be grouped under **Business**.

This is a baseline.  Once you realize that less hassle is better, you will settle on the simplest arrangement of projects that works for you.
