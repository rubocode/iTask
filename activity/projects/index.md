## Projects

Project activity is fast moving and you need all the help from a tool to keep you productive.  Project activity often involves working with people other than yourself and that drives the choice of tools.

I am a consultant and most of my task management is personal.  I use the **Things** app from **Cultured Code**.  It evolved from a line of thinking called **Getting Things Done (GTD)** popularized by **David Allen**.

I sometimes miss the lack of Kanban like task movement.  There are other tools which combine both GTD and Kanban — but does not meet the simplicity, elegance and sophistication criteria up to expectations.

Many organization use Kanban for collaboration.  **Trello**, originally build by **Joel Spolsky** was acquired by **Atlassian** who have a much heavier engine in **Jira**.

My current needs are nicely met by Things.
