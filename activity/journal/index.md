## Journal

Journaling is quite useful in keeping track of your ideas, thought, meeting to telephone call details as necessary.  The journal can also used to collect notable quotes, web links and other minutiae.

I use the **Notes** app for this with a dozen or so folders — corresponding to categories.  You can also use #tags in useful ways as well.
