## Living

Managing life activity boils down to keeping track of your personal commitments.  This is essential core activity to keep your life functional, organized and on a path of progress.  Work and social commitments are not included here.

You have about a dozen lists of tasks at most to manage.  This is also reasonably slow moving.  This is your own personal sphere. This stuff is about you and your family.  Your close friends are in your personal sphere while others belong in the business and social spheres.  It is wise not to mix it up.

You’re keeping track of your bill payments, doctor’s appointments, taxes and tithes.  You have a list for each family member.  Perhaps, also a couple of lists of books — e.g. **Business** and **Technical** — you plan to read.
